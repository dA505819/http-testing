["intro.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction 2.1 What is webmockr? 2.2 What is vcr? 2.3 Why crul? 2.4 Use cases", " Chapter 2 Introduction 2.1 What is webmockr? webmockr is an R package to help you “mock” HTTP requests. What does mock mean? Mock refers to the fact that we’re faking the response. Here is how it works: You “stub” a request. That is, you set rules for what HTTP request you’d like to match on You also can set rules for what you’d like to respond with, if anything (if nothing, then we give you NULL) Then you make HTTP requests, and those that match your stub will return what you requested be returned While webmockr is in use, real HTTP interactions are not allowed There is no recording interactions to disk at all, just mocked responses given as the user specifies in the R session webmockr works with both the crul package and the httr package. Read more about webmockr in Section 2. 2.2 What is vcr? The short version is: vcr helps you stub HTTP requests so you don’t have to repeat HTTP requests. The main use case is for unit tests of R packages. vcr works with both the crul package and the httr package. vcr works by hooking into webmockr. However, when webmockr finds a match, we then look for a recorded interaction on disk. If one is not found, we record the request and response. If one is found, we use that recorded interaction to construct a real response as the R client expects. Read more about vcr in Section 3. 2.3 Why crul? crul is just one of the HTTP clients in R. It’s the one that I maintain though, so was easiest to get started with adding mocking integration. There is now integration with httr for both webmockr and vcr. The major feature that httr has that crul does not have is OAuth support, but that’s not an important use case for me so is not a high priority for crul. A major reason to use crul over httr is that it uses more of an object oriented interface. That is, you create objects that you can call methods on and retrieve variables/results from calls/etc. It’s a different approach than httr which focuses on passing things to functions. 2.4 Use cases 2.4.1 mocking use cases one two three 2.4.2 caching use cases one two three "],
["mocking.html", "Chapter 3 Mocking HTTP Requests 3.1 Package documentation 3.2 Features 3.3 How webmockr works in detail 3.4 Basic usage", " Chapter 3 Mocking HTTP Requests The very very short version is: webmockr helps you stub HTTP requests so you don’t have to repeat yourself. 3.1 Package documentation Check out https://docs.ropensci.org/webmockr/ for documentation on webmockr functions. 3.2 Features Stubbing HTTP requests at low http client lib level Setting and verifying expectations on HTTP requests Matching requests based on method, URI, headers and body Support for testthat via vcr Can be used for testing or outside of a testing context 3.3 How webmockr works in detail You tell webmockr what HTTP request you want to match against and if it sees a request matching your criteria it doesn’t actually do the HTTP request. Instead, it gives back the same object you would have gotten back with a real request, but only with the bits it knows about. For example, we can’t give back the actual data you’d get from a real HTTP request as the request wasn’t performed. In addition, if you set an expectation of what webmockr should return, we return that. For example, if you expect a request to return a 418 error (I’m a Teapot), then that’s what you’ll get. What you can match against HTTP method (required) Plus any single or combination of the following: URI Right now, we can match directly against URI’s, and with regex URI patterns. Eventually, we will support RFC 6570 URI templates. We normalize URI paths so that URL encoded things match URL un-encoded things (e.g. hello world to hello%20world) Query parameters We normalize query parameter values so that URL encoded things match URL un-encoded things (e.g. message = hello world to message = hello%20world) Request headers We normalize headers and treat all forms of same headers as equal. For example, the following two sets of headers are equal: list(H1 = \"value1\", content_length = 123, X_CuStOm_hEAder = \"foo\") list(h1 = \"value1\", \"Content-Length\" = 123, \"x-cuSTOM-HeAder\" = \"foo\") Request body Real HTTP requests There’s a few scenarios to think about when using webmockr: After doing library(webmockr) webmockr is loaded but not turned on. At this point webmockr doesn’t change anythning. Once you turn on webmockr like webmockr::enable() webmockr will now by default not allow real HTTP requests from the http libraries that adapters are loaded for (right now only crul). You can optionally allow real requests via webmockr_allow_net_connect(), and disallow real requests via webmockr_disable_net_connect(). You can check whether you are allowing real requests with webmockr_net_connect_allowed(). Certain kinds of real HTTP requests allowed: We don’t suppoprt this yet, but you can allow localhost HTTP requests with the allow_localhost parameter in the webmockr_configure() function. Storing actual HTTP responses webmockr doesn’t do that.

First, you can create a file with the data you’d like in that file, then tell crul or httr where that file is. Second, you can simply give webmockr a file path (that doesn’t exist yet) and some data, and webmockr can take care of putting the data in the file. Here’s the first method, where you put data in a file as your mock, then pass the file as a connection (with file(&lt;file path&gt;)) to to_return(). ## make a temp file f &lt;- tempfile(fileext = &quot;.json&quot;) ## write something to the file cat(&quot;{\\&quot;hello\\&quot;:\\&quot;world\\&quot;}\\n&quot;, file = f) ## make the stub invisible(stub_request(&quot;get&quot;, &quot;https://httpbin.org/get&quot;) %&gt;% to_return(body = file(f))) ## make a request out &lt;- HttpClient$new(&quot;https://httpbin.org/get&quot;)$get(disk = f) ## view stubbed file content readLines(file(f)) #&gt; [1] &quot;{\\&quot;hello\\&quot;:\\&quot;world\\&quot;}&quot; With the second method, use webmockr::mock_file() to have webmockr handle file and contents. g &lt;- tempfile(fileext = &quot;.json&quot;) ## make the stub invisible(stub_request(&quot;get&quot;, &quot;https://httpbin.org/get?a=b&quot;) %&gt;% to_return(body = mock_file(path = g, payload = &quot;{\\&quot;hello\\&quot;:\\&quot;mars\\&quot;}\\n&quot;))) ## make a request out &lt;- crul::HttpClient$new(&quot;https://httpbin.org/get?a=b&quot;)$get(disk = g) ## view stubbed file content readLines(out$content) #&gt; [1] &quot;{\\&quot;hello\\&quot;:\\&quot;mars\\&quot;}&quot; &quot;&quot; webmockr also supports httr::write_disk(), here letting webmockr handle the mock file creation: library(httr) httr_mock() ## make a temp file f &lt;- tempfile(fileext = &quot;.json&quot;) ## make the stub invisible(stub_request(&quot;get&quot;, &quot;https://httpbin.org/get?cheese=swiss&quot;) %&gt;% to_return( body = mock_file(path = f, payload = &quot;{\\&quot;foo\\&quot;: \\&quot;bar\\&quot;}&quot;), headers = list(&#39;content-type&#39; = &quot;application/json&quot;) )) ## make a request out &lt;- GET(&quot;https://httpbin.org/get?cheese=swiss&quot;, write_disk(f, TRUE)) ## view stubbed file content readLines(out$content) #&gt; [1] &quot;{\\&quot;foo\\&quot;: \\&quot;bar\\&quot;}&quot; "],

Right now the only option is file system, but in the future could be other things, e.g. a key-value store like Redis Persister: defines how to save requests - currently only option is the file system Serializers: defines how to serialize the HTTP response; that is, how the data is stored on whatever the persister is (right now only file system). Currently only option is YAML; other options in the future could include e.g. JSON insert cassette: create a cassette (all HTTP interactions will be recorded to this cassette). once a cassette is inserted, we don’t allow insertion of additional cassettes eject cassette: eject the cassette (no longer recording to that cassette). however, if any interactions were written to disk, those are still stored there replay: refers to using a cached result of an http request that was recorded earlier recording: this means you’ve set vcr in a mode in which we can record HTTP interactions. sometimes recording can be not possible given user configuration or otherwise 7.3 Basic usage library(vcr) library(crul) cli &lt;- crul::HttpClient$new(url = &quot;https://api.crossref.org&quot;) system.time( use_cassette(name = &quot;helloworld&quot;, { cli$get(&quot;works&quot;, query = list(rows = 3)) }) ) #&gt; user system elapsed #&gt; 0.128 0.014 2.191 The request gets recorded, and all subsequent requests of the same form used the cached HTTP response, and so are much faster system.time( use_cassette(name = &quot;helloworld&quot;, { cli$get(&quot;works&quot;, query = list(rows = 3)) }) ) #&gt; user system elapsed #&gt; 0.055 0.003 0.058 Importantly, your unit test deals with the same inputs and the same outputs - but behind the scenes you use a cached HTTP resonse - thus, your tests run faster.

vcr/0.0.8.9521, webmockr/0.2.2.9119, crul/0.5.2 All components of both the request and response are preserved, so that the HTTP client (in this case crul) can reconstruct its own response just as it would if it wasn’t using vcr. 7.4 vcr enabled testing 7.4.1 check vs. test TLDR: Run devtools::test() before running devtools::check() When running tests or checks of your whole package, note that you’ll get different results with devtools::check() vs. devtools::test(). This arises because devtools::check() runs in a temporary directory and files created (vcr cassettes) are only in that temporary directory and thus don’t persist after devtools::check() exits. However, devtools::test() does not run in a temporary directory, so files created (vcr cassettes) are in whatever directory you’re running it in. Alternatively, you can run devtools::test_file() to create your vcr cassettes. The same goes for using the RStudio IDE buttons/keyboard shortcuts. 7.4.2 CRAN There is no one right answer to how to manage your tests for CRAN. The following is a discussion of the various considerations - which should give the reader enough information to make an educated decision. You can run vcr enabled tests on CRAN. CRAN is okay with files associated with tests, and so in general you can run your vcr enabled tests on CRAN just as you run them locally. If you do run your vcr enabled tests on CRAN be aware of a few things: If your vcr enabled tests require any environment variables or R options, they won’t be available on CRAN. In these cases you likely want to skip these tests. If your vcr enabled tests have cassettes with sensitive information in them, you probably do not want to have those cassettes on the internet, in which case you won’t be running vcr enabled tests on CRAN either. In the case of sensitive information, you’ll want to read the gitignore cassettes section If you are worried at all about problems with vcr enabled tests on CRAN you can use testthat::skip_on_cran() to skip specific tests. 7.4.3 CI sites: Travis, Appveyor, etc. Similar considerations are involved when dealing with Travis, Appveyor, Circle-CI, etc. There are a few differences. With CI services you can manage environment variables so you can run tests that require API keys, etc. In addition, if tests fail you aren’t threatened with your package being taken down. "],

See more about the write_disk_path configuration option. Here, we create a temporary directory, then set the fixtures tmpdir &lt;- tempdir() vcr_configure( dir = file.path(tmpdir, &quot;fixtures&quot;), write_disk_path = file.path(tmpdir, &quot;files&quot;) ) #&gt; &lt;vcr configuration&gt; #&gt; Cassette Dir: /var/folders/24/8k48jl6d249_n_qfxwsl6xvm0000gn/T//Rtmpl5f7LF/fixtures #&gt; Record: once #&gt; URI Parser: crul::url_parse #&gt; Match Requests on: method, uri #&gt; Preserve Bytes?: FALSE #&gt; Logging?: FALSE #&gt; ignored hosts: #&gt; ignore localhost?: FALSE #&gt; Write disk path: /var/folders/24/8k48jl6d249_n_qfxwsl6xvm0000gn/T//Rtmpl5f7LF/files Then pass a file path (that doesn’t exist yet) to crul’s disk parameter. vcr will take care of handling writing the response to that file in addition to the cassette. library(crul) ## make a temp file f &lt;- tempfile(fileext = &quot;.json&quot;) ## make a request cas &lt;- use_cassette(&quot;test_write_to_disk&quot;, { out &lt;- HttpClient$new(&quot;https://httpbin.org/get&quot;)$get(disk = f) }) file.exists(out$content) #&gt; [1] TRUE out$parse() #&gt; [1] &quot;{\\n \\&quot;args\\&quot;: {}, \\n \\&quot;headers\\&quot;: {\\n \\&quot;Accept\\&quot;: \\&quot;application/json, text/xml, application/xml, */*\\&quot;, \\n \\&quot;Accept-Encoding\\&quot;: \\&quot;gzip, deflate\\&quot;, \\n \\&quot;Host\\&quot;: \\&quot;httpbin.org\\&quot;, \\n \\&quot;User-Agent\\&quot;: \\&quot;libcurl/7.64.1 r-curl/4.3 crul/0.9.0\\&quot;, \\n \\&quot;X-Amzn-Trace-Id\\&quot;: \\&quot;Root=1-5e3c6343-20cacefbc6ca41fde1cae19f\\&quot;\\n }, \\n \\&quot;origin\\&quot;: \\&quot;199.7.166.17\\&quot;, \\n \\&quot;url\\&quot;: \\&quot;https://httpbin.org/get\\&quot;\\n}\\n&quot; This also works with httr. The only difference is that you write to disk with a function httr::write_disk(path) rather than a parameter. Note that when you write to disk when using vcr, the cassette is slightly changed.

Record new interactions if there is no cassette file. Cause an error to be raised for new requests if there is a cassette file. It is similar to the new_episodes record mode, but will prevent new, unexpected requests from being made (i.e. because the request URI changed or whatever). once is the default record mode, used when you do not set one. 10.2 none The none record mode will: Replay previously recorded interactions. Cause an error to be raised for any new requests. This is useful when your code makes potentially dangerous HTTP requests. The none record mode guarantees that no new HTTP requests will be made. 10.3 new_episodes The new_episodes record mode will: Record new interactions. Replay previously recorded interactions. It is similar to the once record mode, but will always record new interactions, even if you have an existing recorded one that is similar (but not identical, based on the match_request_on option). 10.4 all The all record mode will: Record new interactions.

["security.html", "Chapter 13 security 13.1 API keys and such 13.2 API keys and tests run in varied contexts 13.3 Other security", " Chapter 13 security 13.1 API keys and such The configuration parameter filter_sensitive_data accepts a named list. Each element in the list should be of the following format: thing_to_replace_it_with = thing_to_replace We replace all instances of thing_to_replace with thing_to_replace_it_with. Before recording (writing to a cassette) we do the replacement and then when reading from the cassette we do the reverse replacement to get back to the real data. The before record replacement happens in an internal function write_interactions(), while before playback replacement happens in internal function YAML$deserialize_path() vcr_configure( filter_sensitive_data = list(&quot;&lt;&lt;&lt;my_api_key&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot; = Sys.getenv(&#39;API_KEY&#39;)) ) You want to make the string that replaces your sensitive string something that won’t be easily found elsewhere in the response body/headers/etc. It’s a good idea to not in place of thing_to_replace put your actual sensitive key thing, because that defeats the purpose of trying to protect your private data. This is why we highly recommend setting your API keys as environment variables, then you can as seen above just put a call to Sys.getenv(), which we’ll use internally to get your key, find it anywhere in the HTTP responses, and replace it with your placeholder string. The reason you want to do this is because you may on purpose or on accident push your cassettes to the public web, and when that happens you don’t want your private keys in those cassettes. Note that the way this is implemented in vcr is not super elegant and is not general with respect to the serializer. We only support YAML serializing right now, but when we support other serializers we’ll need to change the implementation. 13.2 API keys and tests run in varied contexts When vcr enabled tests are run in different contexts (laptops, CI services, containers, etc.), and those tests can optionally use authentication you can run into problems. An example will best illustrate the issue. Given an R package foo, the package maintainer sets up tests with vcr. Functions in package foo can optionally use an API key supplied by the user. For the purposes of this example, the API key when given is included as a query parameter (it is not good pratice to pass API keys as query parameter, but its not uncommon). When the maintainer runs tests locally on their own machine they can unset the environment variable that holds their API key so its not included in vcr cassettes. Additionally, when they run tests on CI systems (e.g., Travis-CI), they do not have an API key set. When tests are run in either of these two locations, the API key is not included in the requests, and thus not included in the cassettes. Now, consider a contributor that forks the repository and as a first run through the package installs the package, then runs tests. If this contributor does not have an API key set, the tests should run fine. However, once the contributor sets their API key and attempts to run tests (or imagine another contributor that already has an API key set), the tests will fail because the URI now contains an API key as a query parameter in the URL. There’s various combinations of the above problem. One option for dealing with this is requiring an API key to be set. If you do this you likely want to make sure your actual key is not in the cassettes that will be pushed to the public web; see the bit about filter_sensitive_data above for that. If you do require an API key, then you can ensure that whenever tests are run an API key is required; that way there’s no way that tests will be run with AND without a key - which can lead to problems. Requiring an API key means you can’t run tests in environments where it’s not possible to safely set a key, e.g., on CRAN (in which case you must skip tests). There’s no magic way around this problem ~ it’s a good thing to be aware of, especially if other people contribute to your package. 13.3 Other security Let us know about any other security concerns! Surely there’s things we haven’t considered yet. "],

The following are different ways to allow real HTTP requests. 14.1 lightswitch: vcr, webmockr and their on/off states After loading vcr, webmockr is not loaded, thus real HTTP requests are allowed. library(vcr) After loading webmockr you can still make real HTTP requests. library(webmockr) But after turning mocking on you can’t make real requests crul::mock() # OR webmockr::enable() And you’ll get errors that come from webmockr when attempting real HTTP requests HttpClient$new(url = &quot;https://httpbin.org/get&quot;)$get() #&gt; Error: Real HTTP connections are disabled. #&gt; Unregistered request: GET https://httpbin.org/get with headers {Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate} #&gt; #&gt; You can stub this request with the following snippet: #&gt; #&gt; stub_request(&#39;get&#39;, uri = &#39;https://httpbin.org/get&#39;) %&gt;% #&gt; wi_th(headers = list(&#39;Accept-Encoding&#39; = &#39;gzip, deflate&#39;)) You can have vcr loaded but if you’re not using use_casette 14.2 turned_off turned_off() lets you temporarily make a real HTTP request without completely turning vcr off, unloading it, etc. What happens internally is we turn off vcr, run your code block, then on exit turn vcr back on - such that vcr is onl turned off for the duration of your code block running. Even if your code block errors, vcr will be turned back on due to use of on.exit(turn_on()) library(vcr) library(crul) turned_off({ res &lt;- HttpClient$new(url = &quot;https://httpbin.org/get&quot;)$get() }) res #&gt; &lt;crul response&gt; #&gt; url: https://httpbin.org/get #&gt; request_headers: #&gt; User-Agent: libcurl/7.54.0 r-curl/3.2 crul/0.5.2 #&gt; Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate #&gt; Accept: application/json, text/xml, application/xml, */* #&gt; response_headers: #&gt; status: HTTP/1.1 200 OK #&gt; server: nginx #&gt; date: Fri, 27 Apr 2018 23:22:44 GMT #&gt; content-type: application/json #&gt; content-length: 330 #&gt; connection: keep-alive #&gt; access-control-allow-origin: * #&gt; access-control-allow-credentials: true #&gt; x-powered-by: Flask #&gt; x-processed-time: 0 #&gt; status: 200 14.3 turn_off "],
["managing-cassettes.html", "Chapter 15 managing cassettes 15.1 gitignore cassettes 15.2 Rbuildignore cassettes 15.3 deleting cassettes 15.4 cassette file types", " Chapter 15 managing cassettes Be aware when you add your cassettes to either .gitignore and/or .Rbuildignore. 15.1 gitignore cassettes The .gitignore file lets you tell [git][] what files to ignore - those files are not tracked by git and if you share the git repository to the public web, those files in the .gitignore file won’t be shared in the public version. When using vcr you may want to include your cassettes in the .gitignore file. You may wan to when your cassettes contain sensitive data that you don’t want to have on the internet &amp; dont want to hide with filter_sensitive_data. You may want to have your cassettes included in your GitHub repo, both to be present when tests run on CI, and when others run your tests. There’s no correct answer on whether to gitignore your cassettes. Think about security implications and whether you want CI and human contributors to use previously created cassettes or to create/use their own. 15.2 Rbuildignore cassettes The .Rbuildignore file is used to tell R to ignore certain files/directories. There’s not a clear use case for why you’d want to add vcr cassettes to your .Rbuildignore file, but if you do be aware that will affect your vcr enabled tests. 15.3 deleting cassettes Removing a cassette is as easy as deleting in your file finder, or from the command line, or from within a text editor or RStudio. If you delete a cassette, on the next test run the cassette will be recorded again. If you do want to re-record a test to a cassette, instead of deleting the file you can toggle record modes. 15.4 cassette file types For right now the only persistence option is yaml. So all files have a .yml extension. When other persister options are added, additional file types may be found. The next persister type is likely to be JSON, so if you use that option, you’d have .json files instead of .yml files. "],
["gotchas.html", "Chapter 16 gotchas 16.1 Correct line identification", " Chapter 16 gotchas There’s a few things to watch out for when using vcr. Security: Don’t put your secure API keys, tokens, etc. on the public web. See the Security chapter (13) API key issues: Running vcr enabled tests in different contexts when API keys are used can have some rough edges. See (13.2) Dates: Be careful when using dates in tests with vcr. e.g. if you generate todays date, and pass that in to a function in your package that uses that date for an HTTP request, the date will be different from the one in the matching cassette, causing a vcr failure. HTTP errors: It’s a good idea to test failure behavior of a web service in your test suite. Sometimes vcr can handle that and sometimes it cannot. Open any issues about this because ideally i think vcr could handle all cases of HTTP failures. Very large response bodies: A few things about large response bodies. First, vcr may give you trouble with very large response bodies as we’ve see yaml parsing problems already. Second, large response bodies means large cassettes on disk - so just be aware of the file size if that’s something that matters to you. Third, large response bodies will take longer to load into R, so you may still have a multi second test run even though the test is using a cached HTTP response. Encoding: We haven’t dealt with encoding much yet at all, so we’re likely to run into encoding issues. One blunt instrument for this for now is to set preserve_exact_body_bytes = TRUE when running vcr::use_cassette() or vcr::insert_cassette(), which stores the response body as base64. devtools::check vs. devtools::test: See (7.4.1) ignored files: See (15) 16.1 Correct line identification To get the actual lines where failures occur, you can wrap the test_that block in a use_cassette() block: library(testthat) vcr::use_cassette(&quot;rl_citation&quot;, { test_that(&quot;my test&quot;, { aa &lt;- rl_citation() expect_is(aa, &quot;character&quot;) expect_match(aa, &quot;IUCN&quot;) expect_match(aa, &quot;www.iucnredlist.org&quot;) }) }) OR put the use_cassette() block on the inside, but make sure to put testthat expectations outside of the use_cassette() block: library(testthat) test_that(&quot;my test&quot;, { vcr::use_cassette(&quot;rl_citation&quot;, { aa &lt;- rl_citation() }) expect_is(aa, &quot;character&quot;) expect_match(aa, &quot;IUCN&quot;) expect_match(aa, &quot;www.iucnredlist.org&quot;) }) Do not wrap the use_cassette() block inside your test_that() block with testthat expectations inside the use_cassette() block, as you’ll only get the line number that the use_cassette() block starts on on failures.

["testing-considerations.html", "Chapter 17 Testing considerations", " Chapter 17 Testing considerations When should you use webmockr vs. vcr vs. testing real HTTP interactions? There is no right answer to this question, but rather a range of considerations. On one hand, it seems appropriate to think about testing your R package in a way that is not sensitive to the remote service the package interacts with being down/etc. However, part of the user experience of using your package will be dealing with intermittent server side issues, for which ideally your package is robust to, and/or at least fails well in reponse to. Of course you can still test your package against failure scenarios without testing real interactions. In addition to intermittent server side issues, your tests may be performing queries with cached (vcr) or mocked (webmockr) responses that are no longer valid with the current state of the remote service. It may be harmless, for example, the response to some query now returns no data because the data for that entity was removed. But it could be more serious in that the remove service changed their API such that an API route is no longer available or the route name has changed, or similar. Testing real HTTP interactions should be the slowest option, but has the benefit of not adding any (permanent) files to your package. Mocking tests can be very lite weight, though you can include very heavy responses. Using vcr to cache real responses can lead to many files and sometimes files of large size. It’s worth thinking about this trade-off between speed of tests, what can be tested, and files added to your package. If you’re working with in a team, and if you’re using vcr, you need to consider where files are stored and make sure access to those files doesn’t vary by team member. A last option is to create a very minimal fake service to run your tests against. The consultancy Thoughtbot wrote a nice post on How to Stub External Services in Tests. Using Ruby, they briefly described mocking with webmock (similar to webmockr in R), using vcr (similar to vcr in R), and creating a “fake” (fake service). Some have found they really don’t like having the added vcr cassettes in their projects, and thus prefer mocking. See for example this post. "],
